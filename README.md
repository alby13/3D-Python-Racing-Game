# A 3D Python Car Racing Game
3D Python Racing Game USA! The world deserved a 3D Car Racing Game in the legendary Python programming language and I was going to deliver one.

## Install Pygame First
```
pip install Pygame
```

This will get you the library that the game needs to run.

## How to play:
Note: In order to move, you have to shift gears. Currently Left SHFT and CTRL keys shift up and down.

```
Press "W" Key to Accelerate (Press Gas Pedal)
Press "S" Key to Brake and Reverse
Turn with "A" and "D" Keys for Left and Right
```

This game is a proof of concept as a 3D Python racing game. It plays a background song (included) that should be in the folder where the program is launched. This uses Python 3.10+, PyGame
